# ElytraDeathHandler
ElytraDeathHandler is a Minecraft (Java Edition) plugin. 

## Description
Players typically use an Elytra to explore, and travel hundreds of blocks from their home. When a player dies by flying into a wall, or a rough landing, they're normally hundreds of blocks from their death location. Essentials /back is buggy, and clearlag is notorious for consuming the dropped items. 

BetterDeathHandler changes this inconvinience for the player, by verifying whether they died because of an elytra, and giving them a clickable chat component to return to their death location.

## Installation
Plugin is to be published on Spigot soon. 
Installation instructions will follow.
